"                    <p>Think of all the terrible things governments do to "
"the Internet. The US destroyed Megaupload, Russia jailed activists over a "
"Youtube video, and China monitors Internet users' every move-- even hacking "
"activists outside its borders.</p>\n"
"                    <p>Now imagine if a panel of governments, giant "
"corporations, and dictatorships had absolute power over the entire Internet, "
"deciding in secret what you can see &amp; do online.</p>\n"
"                    <p>When the ITU meets December 3rd, this could happen. "
